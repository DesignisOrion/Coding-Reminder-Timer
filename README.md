# Coding Reminder Timer 

### About 
This program allows you to be reminded when to study Python.

### Technologies Used:
- Python 3

### What I learned:
In this project I wanted to work closely with "threading". A thread is a separate flow of execution. This means that your program will have two things happening at once. But for most Python 3 implementations the different threads do not actually execute at the same time: they merely appear to. In this program I was able to set the timer to .5 seconds so that all can be seen rapidly of results. You can change the timer to your preference as well as messages. Enjoy!
